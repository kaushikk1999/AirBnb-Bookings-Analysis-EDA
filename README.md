Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting travelers with local hosts who offer unique accommodation options. As the popularity of the platform continues to grow, understanding the dynamics of the Airbnb market becomes crucial for hosts and stakeholders to make informed decisions. In this context, the problem is to analyze Airbnb booking data to gain insights into the market trends, such as the demand and supply of accommodations, the most popular types of properties, the peak booking seasons, the pricing patterns, and the factors that influence the booking decisions of guests.
